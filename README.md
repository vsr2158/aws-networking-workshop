AWS Account ID | AWS Region | AWS Region CIDR | TGW AS Number| DC CIDR| DC AS Number| Student Number | Student Name
------------------|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|----
AWS-Account-ID| us-east-1 |  10.0.0.0/16 | 64520 |192.168.0.0/24 | 65000| 0| Spider Man
AWS-Account-ID| us-east-2 |  10.1.0.0/16 | 64521 |192.168.1.0/24 | 65001| 1| Captain America

AWS-Account-ID| us-west-2 |  10.3.0.0/16 | 64523 |192.168.3.0/24 | 65003| 3| Bat Man
AWS-Account-ID| ap-south-1 |  10.X.0.0/16 | 6452x |192.168.x.0/24 | 6500X| x| XXXXXXXX

* Download all the CloudFormation templates from the directory `/CloudFormation` and save on your workstation. 

* In each AWS account create a S3 bucket with a unique name (S3 is a global namespace) like `<AWS-Account-ID>-nw-workshop-templates` and upload all the CloudFormation templates you downloaded in previous step. Note this needs to be done only once in each account.

Your core steps are now complete, please proceed to the next module.

## Module1: Deploy Multi VPC AWS Infrastructure
#### Deploy CloudFormation template
* On AWS console, nagivate to `CloudFormation` service, ensure you are in the right region as allocated part of `Core Instructions`
* Click on `Create Stack` > `Template is ready` > `Upload a template file` > `Chose file` > locate and upload the file named `nw-workshop-master`
*  In `Stack Name` input a meaningful name , under parameters specify the `RegionCIDR` as allocated part of `Core Instructions` and leave the `EnvironemtName` as default.
* Accept defaults in next screen and select `Next`
* Towards the bottom under Capabilities Section accept:
    * `I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.` 
    * `I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND` 
    *  Click `Create Stack`
* Stack creation will commence and will invoke nested stacks as required, you can watch the events  under the `Events Tab` on the console. Wait for the stack deployment to complete.
* Post Stack Deployment following resources are created:

    < Todo: Add a diagram of resources deployed > 
    
* TASK: Explore the deployed resources, test SSH login to all the instances deployed by this CloudFormation stack. Note that instances in private subnet will require SSH from the Bastion host in Public subnet.
* TASK: Test reachability between all EC2 instances. Is there connectivity between EC2 instances within the VPC? Is there connectivity between EC2 instances between the VPCs?
  

## Module2: AWS Transit Gateway deployment and migration from VPC peering 
#### Setup connectivity so the private instances in different VPCs can communicate between each other.
* Task: Identify the two VPCs deployed using CloudFormation, setup VPC peering between them. Is there connectivity between EC2 instances between the VPCs now? Leave the terminal open and Ping running for later tasks.


* Optional Bonus Task: With with a partner who has deployed in a different region and achieve connectivity with that instance
* Optional Bonus Task: What is the max MTU supported between the instances within same Region? What is max MTU supported between instances across regions?

This module is now complete, please proceed to the next module.

#### Migrate from VPC peering to Transit Gateway (TGW) based connectivity with minimum downtime
 
* Task: Deploy Transit Gateway (TGW) in the region. Remember TGW is a regional router and you can connect all VPCs in the same region belonging to this and other accounts to a single TGW

* Task: Create a TGW attachment to the VPC, check the TGW default roue table, what do you see? (A:CIDR from each VPC should be propogated to this route table)
* Task: Notice the Ping responses between the instances continue without any interruption, why? (A: VPC route table still is pointing to the VPC peering connection to route to the other VPC) Now change the VPC Route table to point to the TGW attachment instead of VPC peering connection on both VPCs. How long many ICMP packets were lost? Can you deduct the approximate outage time?
* Optional Bonus Task: In the previous step you enabled routing between two VPCs via TGW. What should you do to allow all communication via TGW? (A: Add a single 10.0.0.0/8 route for all the VPCs pointing towards TGW attachment ) 
* Optional Bonus Task: 

This module is now complete, please proceed to the next module.

## Module3: Data Center (DC) Connectivity

In this module we will simulate a DC deployed on seperate AWS account (This can be the same account in an unused region) 

#### Create a site2site VPN in TGW
 * We will create a dummy CGW device, this will be replaced with a real CGW device later. Why?
 * On the AWS console in ensure you are in the correct region:
    * Navigate to `VPC` > `Customer Gateways` >  `Create Customer Gateway`
    * Name it a `Dummy-CGW1`
    * Routing `Dynamic`
    * BGP ASN `as allocated under core instructions "DC AS Number"`
    * IP Address `1.1.1.1`
 * We will now create a VPN connection:
 * On the AWS console in ensure you are in the correct region:
    * Navigate to `VPC` > `Site-to-Site VPN Connections` >  `Create VPN Connection`
    * Name it a `DC-VPN-Connection`
    * For "Target Gateway Type" select `Transit Gateway` option and select the TGW you have created earlier
    * Under `Customer Gateway` option select `Existing` and select `Dummy-CGW1`
    * Routing Options `Dynamic`
    * Tunnel Inside Ip Version `IPv4`
    * Leave `Local IPv4 Network Cidr` and `Remote IPv4 Network Cidr` as `0.0.0.0/0` default
    * Under `Tunnel Optons` > `Inside IPv4 CIDR for Tunnel 1` specify `169.254.10.0/30`
    * Under `Tunnel Optons` > `Pre-Shared Key for Tunnel 1` specify `awsamazon`
    * Under `Tunnel Optons` > `Inside IPv4 CIDR for Tunnel 2` specify `169.254.11.0/30`
    * Under `Tunnel Optons` > `Pre-Shared Key for Tunnel 2` specify `awsamazon`
    * Leave `Advanced Options for Tunnel 1` and `Advanced Options for Tunnel 2` as default and create vpn connection
 * Wait for a few mins for the VPN connection to be created, during the creation state you can select the VPN Connection and click on `Tunnel Detail` tab. Note down the `Outside IP Address` of both Tunnel1 and Tunnel2
  


#### Deploy CloudFormation template to simulate DC
* On AWS console of account #2, nagivate to `CloudFormation` service, ensure you are in the right region as allocated part of `Core Instructions`
* Click on `Create Stack` > `Template is ready` > `Upload a template file` > `Chose file` > locate and upload the file named `nw-workshop-dc-master`
* Input a meaningful `Stack Name`.
* Under parameters 
    * specify the `CgwAs`, this is the Customger Gateway Autonomous System number as allocated part of `Core Instructions`.
    * specify the `TgwAs`, this is the Transit Gateway Autonomous System number as allocated part of `Core Instructions`.
    * specify the `Tunnel1Ip`, this is the Tunnel1 `Outside IP Address` as shown after the Site2 Site VPN creation as noted from `Tunnel Detail` tab. 
    * specify the `Tunnel2Ip`, this is the Tunnel2 `Outside IP Address` as shown after the Site2 Site VPN creation as noted from `Tunnel Detail` tab. 
    * specify the `VpcCidr` as allocated part of `Core Instructions`.
* Under parameters specify the `DatacenterCIDR` as allocated part of `Core Instructions`.

and leave the `EnvironemtName` as default.
* Accept defaults in next screen and select `Next`
* Towards the bottom under Capabilities Section accept:
    * `I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.` 
    * `I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND` 
    *  Click `Create Stack`
* Stack creation will commence, you can watch the events  under the `Events Tab` on the console. Wait for the stack deployment to complete.
* Post Stack Deployment following resources are created:

    < Todo: Add a diagram of resources deployed > 
    
* Task: Explore the deployed resources, test SSH login to all the DC Bastion instances deployed by this CloudFormation stack.
* Task: Note down the Bastion Host's public IP address, repeat the CGW creation steps exactly as before but this time specify Bastion Host's public IP address as CGW IP address

We now have the DC environment ready, however the Site-2Site VPN is pointing the VPN tunnel to the Dummy-CGW lets replce it with the correct CGW
 * We will start by creating a new and correct CGW device
 * On the AWS console in ensure you are in the correct region:
    * Navigate to `VPC` > `Customer Gateways` >  `Create Customer Gateway`
    * Name it a `DC-CGW`
    * Routing `Dynamic`
    * BGP ASN `as allocated under core instructions "DC AS Number"`
    * IP Address `specify the Public IP address of your DC bastion host`
   
* To replace the newly created CGW with Dummy-CGW Navigate to `VPC` > `Site-to-Site VPN Connections` >   Select the VPN connection you created > under `Actions` > `Modify VPN Connection` > `Target Type` > `Customer Gateway` > Specify the newly created CGW > save
This step can take anytime between 5-15 mins, after the modification you should see both IPSEC Tunnels UP and BGP connections UP
* Task: How does the TGW routing table look? Is it learning routes from the VPN? Are VPC route tables updated automatically?
* Task: Update VPC main route table to point to TGW Attachment for the DC VPC CIDR block. Ping from the Bastion Host from your AWS VPC to the DC DNS server to verify
